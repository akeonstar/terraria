# Terraria

Repo to house my Terraria server setup

## Into

I would like to create a simplier way of setting up a terraria server.  The goal would be to have an ansible playbook to control the server, and a var file for terraria settings, maybe cloud hosting vars as well.  I'm going to focus on the linux side of things, and perhaps some improvments to the way terraria saves/backsup.

## Requirments to use
Going to try and keep the requirements pretty light.  I'm going to be using pop!_os 20.04 for my workstation, with virtualbox. 

- Vagrant + hypervisor of choice. 

### other notes. 

Sad to find out that they have removed old versions from the site. Not 100% sure i can correctly test installing by specifiying a version.  
I'm curious to test with a couple different configurations. Right now I guess i'm manually testing via logging in through my gaming machine.
